#summary General Design doc of Network Controller System.

=Network Controller System=

===Background Introduction===
The network has turned very complex. Some applications need reliability and high-speed (At least measurable, that is to say, the time can be set into a scope) network. Like the video controller system, it needs a network controller to manage and monitor the whole network jobs. 


===General design===
There would be a cluster in this network (Now, it is in a LAN). When you initialize the cluster on one node, this node would be the master one. The master node in this network would be the core one, which could add/remove/... nodes to this cluster. Basically, the nodes in this cluster would send packages from one to another. The time and other parameters should be controlled during this procedure.

===Features===
 * Control the network in this cluster
 * Send packages with time limitation (Analyse and Study real time network)

===Detail desgin===
 * cluster level
{{{
1, ncs-cluster init clutser.harrycluster.com
This would init the cluster and the command runs on the master node.

2, ncs-cluster info
This would get the cluster information.

3, ncs-cluster getmaster
This would show the master node of this cluster.

4, ncs-cluster destroy
This would destroy the cluster.
}}}

 * node level
{{{
1, ncs-node add/remove node.harrycluster.com
This would add/remove a node in this cluster.
}}}
